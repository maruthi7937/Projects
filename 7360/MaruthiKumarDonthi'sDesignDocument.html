	<h2>Media: </h2> 
	
	Nearly all the multimedia files like images, audio, video files will be taken from internet. I will give due credit to the sources of the files. 
	I will only be incorporating the freely available files over internet. Also there will be a disclaimer in home page such as "The multimedia elements used in the website do not belong to me and 
	they have been taken from different sources with proper credit given to the sources at appropriate places in this website. Some of the images which are 
	copyrighted are clearly marked with copy; in the caption. User is advised to take permission from the relevant sources." I will also be creating my own logo using software paint. 
	
	<!-- Heading 2 --> 
	<h2>Color scheme and rationale:</h2> 
	<!-- For paragraph text we use <p>--> 
	<p> Since most of Online Shopping web sites using light background colors .I would like the background to be in the light colors (gray). The other colors used would be black (for text ) and blue (for headings).So I am going to use these colors in my final website. I might be using all these colors to create my logo. <a href="DesDocColorSamples_maruthid.docx">Examples of my colors</a>.
 Samples of the colors used are shown below: </p> 


<div style="background-color: #000000; text-align: center; color:#FFF;line-height: 30px; width: 200px; margin: 10px;"> Black </div> 
<div style="background-color: #D7D7D7; text-align: center; color:#FFF;line-height: 30px; width: 200px; margin: 10px;"> Gray </div>
