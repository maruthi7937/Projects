 she has completed her under graduation majoring in computer science from Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology, India. 
I have seen her work and thought of her as a good candidate for evaluating my pilot website since she has work experience in a software company.
I asked her to take a look at the code and provide some feedback.  She used Mozilla Firefox version 17.0 to view my website on a Lenovo thinkpad
with Core I3 2.30 GHz processor, 4GB RAM and Windows 7 Ultimate Operating System(64 Bit) to perform evaluation .

Windows 7 Home Premium (64 bit) operating system to perform the evaluation while using internet service provided by his university and browser being Google Chrome 5.0.</p></li>

<p>Every one felt the navigation through the website was very easy. 
The overall appeal was easy to the eye and the structure was simple but neat. Everyone liked the simplicity of the website and gave good comments about
 it. A few suggested that I could add a little more content like special offers of products.</p>

 that he liked the website. He also commented that my web page does have some good images. He suggested me to inlcude some external links to show more details of products.</p>
 
 <p> Jeevana evaluated my page as tester. she suggested me to add more categories. she liked the idea of putting images and then product descripton in the webpage. She thought it made the website more appealing.</p>

 <p>Bhardwaj and Sathish had almost the same reviews.They wanted me to include more content like discount offers on products. They both mentioned that web page has good color scheme and backgorund theme, and said they are 
 looking forward for the final website.I assured them that i will add more relevant content.</p>
 
  <p>Overall, all of them said that the website had a good space usage. 
There were three different browsers used; Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer in testing and all of them worked fine displaying the same result.

<h2>Recommended/Planned Changes</h2>

<!-- Improving Design and Navigation -->
<p>Based on the feedback that I have collected, I propose making changes in the following areas:</p>
<p><u><em>Improving Design and Navigation</em></u></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Empty Space </strong>I am planning to clear out the empty space by adding a few more lines/ content 
  on the website so that it does not look blank.This was suggested by Sathish.</li>

</ul>

<!-- Enriching content -->
<p><u><em>Enriching content</em></u></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Links for More Information:</strong> I would like to add more website links in the content so that the 
  audience can get more detailed information.</li>
  <li><strong>More content:</strong> I would like to add more content for product desription by adding discount offers information.</li>  
</ul>

<!--Reflections on your evaluation process Section -->
<h2>Reflections on Evaluation Process</h2>

<p>I am really happy after I performed this evaluation process. It was useful in various ways- the first and most important thing I go
to notice the perception of different people about my website. It also helped me to get an overview of how target users understand the website
and content in it. Also by performing evaluation, the four of them gave me suggestions to make improvements, for which I thank them. Also, 
all the evaluator&#39;s different viewpoints in their mind has helped me understand how different each person would see a page.
</p>

<p>Finally I would like to conclude by saying that this evaluation has helped me a lot by different  
  suggestions, changes provided by the evaluators. This makes site more robust and as suggested by my evaluators, I will add more media like images and also 
  the power point presentation. I will make changes keeping in mind a casual visitor&#39;s perspective.</p>
